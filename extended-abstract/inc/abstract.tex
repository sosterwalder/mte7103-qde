The design and development of a software for~\emph{modeling}, \emph{composing}
and \emph{rendering} real time computer graphics is presented. Modeling and
composing are facilitated by a graphical user interface providing toolbox like
elements. For rendering a highly optimized algorithm based on ray tracing called
sphere tracing is used. The algorithm allows rendering ray traced scenes in real
time on the GPU. For the development of the software a method
called~\emph{literate programming} is used.
