The design and development of a software for~\emph{modeling}, \emph{composing}
and \emph{rendering} real time computer graphics is presented. Modeling and
composing are facilitated by a graphical user interface providing toolbox like
elements. For rendering a highly optimized algorithm based on ray tracing is
used. The algorithm is called sphere tracing and allows the rendering of ray
traced scenes in real time on the GPU. For the development of the software a
method called~\emph{literate programming} is used.
