The design and development of a program for~\emph{modeling}, \emph{composing}
and \emph{rendering} computer graphics in real-time is presented. Modeling and
composing are facilitated by a graphical user interface providing toolbox
elements. For rendering, a highly optimized algorithm based on ray tracing is
used: sphere tracing. For the development and documentation of the software, a
method called~\emph{literate programming} is used.
