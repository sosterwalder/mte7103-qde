\section{Conclusion and outlook}

\newthought{Literate programming takes some time to get into} as it requires
another way of thinking as when developing software in conventional ways. Albeit
this circumstance, the set of basic goals could be reached. Sphere tracing is a
very interesting and promising approach to rendering and it starts to getting
used by the industry, for example for calculating ambient occlusion or soft
shadows. Time will tell if it will establish itself further and may even be used
for rendering conventional meshes.
