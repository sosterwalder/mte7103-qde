\section{Conclusion and outlook}

\newthought{Literate programming takes some accustomization} as it requires a
different way of thinking to that of conventional software development. Despite
this, the basic goals could be reached. Sphere tracing is a very interesting and
promising approach to rendering which is coming into use in the industry, for
example for calculating ambient occlusion or soft shadows. Time will tell if the
method will establish itself further and become practicable for rendering
conventional meshes.
