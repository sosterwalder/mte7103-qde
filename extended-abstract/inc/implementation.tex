\section{Implementation}

\newthought{The results of this thesis} are an architecture for a software and
the software itself, written using the literate programming paradigm.
\newthought{Three aspects define the software architecture:}
\begin{enumerate*}
  \item The model-view-view model software design pattern using additionally
    controllers,
  \item the layers software architectural pattern and
  \item the observer software design pattern, allowing communication between
    components of the software.
\end{enumerate*}
\newthought{The software itself} is an editor which allows~\emph{modeling}
objects, ~\emph{composing} objects to scenes and~\emph{rendering} scenes in
real-time. Scenes are stored in a scene graph structure and represented by a
tree view. Each scene can contain one or more objects, being defined by external
files, represented as nodes in a node based graph structure. The parameters of
objects are used for interconnection between nodes. For rendering the sphere
tracing algorithm was used, which was established in the preceding project work.

% The editor was written in the python programming language
% using the literate programming paradigm and uses the Qt framework as basis and
% for the graphical user interface as well as OpenGL for rendering.

% The graph structure allows adding, removing and connecting nodes to
% complex objects. Every node has one ore more parameters, such as size or
% position (of an object).

% \newthought{Compositing} includes two aspects: the
% composition of objects into scenes and the composition of an animation which is
% defined by multiple scenes which follow a chronological order. The first aspect
% is realized by a scene graph structure, which contains at least a root scene.
% Each scene may contain objects in form of nodes which can be connected. The
% second aspect is realized by a time line, which allows a chronological
% organization of scenes.

% \newthought{For rendering} a highly optimized algorithm
% based on ray tracing is used. The algorithm is called sphere tracing and allows
% the rendering of ray traced scenes in real time on the GPU. Real-time means in
% this context being able to generate at least 25 images in one second. Contingent
% upon the used rendering algorithm all models are modeled using implicit
% surfaces. For rendering the sphere tracing algorithm was used, which was
% established in the preceding project work,~\citetitle{osterwalder-volume-2016}.
