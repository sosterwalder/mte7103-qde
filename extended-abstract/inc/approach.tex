\section{Approach}

\newthought{To reach the intended goal,} the approach was to develop a software
architecture and to use literate programming and the agile methodology of
extreme programming for development.~\emph{Literate programming} was introduced
in~\citeyear{knuth-lp-1984} by~\citeauthor{knuth-lp-1984} and considers programs
as works of literature. A literate program includes documentation which explains
in human terms what the computer must do. To overcome one of the main challenges
when developing the software --- continual change --- an adapted version of
extreme programming was used. This methodology was selected because of
experiences with projects involving continual adaption in which exact planning,
analysis and design (as traditional methodologies require) would not have been
very practical.
