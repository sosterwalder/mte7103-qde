\section{Approach}

\newthought{To reach the intended goal,} the approach was to develop a software
architecture, use literate programming and the agile methodology extreme
programming for development.~\emph{Literate programming} was introduced
in~\citeyear{knuth-lp-1984} by~\citeauthor{knuth-lp-1984} and proposes to
consider programs to be works of literature and to explain to human beings what
the computer shall do to achieve certain goals. To overcome one of the main
challenges when developing the software --- change --- an adapted version of
extreme programming was used. This methodology was chosen as after the preceding
project work several things were still subject to change and therefore an exact
planning, analysis and design, as traditional methodologies require it, would
not have been very practical.
