Instead it would be nice to have at least a window shown when starting the
application, which allows a normal, deterministic and convenient shut down of
the application, either by a keyboard shortcut or by selecting an appropriate
option in the applications' menu.

But having only a plain window is not that interesting, so this might be a good
time to look at the components of the editor, which are defined by
\citep[p. 29 ff.]{osterwalder_qde_2016} and are the following:

- A scene graph, allowing the creation and deletion of scenes. The scene graph
  has at least a root scene.
- A node-based graph structure, allowing the composition of scenes using nodes
  and connections between the nodes.
- A parameter window, showing parameters of the currently selected graph node.
- A rendering window, rendering the currently selected node or scene.
- A sequencer, allowing a time-based scheduling of defined scenes.

What \cite{osterwalder_qde_2016} does not explicitly mention, is the main
window, which holds all those components and allows a proper shut down of the
application.

As a starting point, we shall implement the class {{{verb(MainWindow)}}}
representing the main window.
