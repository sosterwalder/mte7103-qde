This chapter describes the planned directory structure as well as how the usage
of name-spaces is intended.

The whole source code shall be placed in the =src= directory underneath the main
directory. The creation of the single directories is not explicitly shown
respectively done, instead the =:mkdirp= option provided by the source code
block structure is used[fn:11:http://orgmode.org/manual/mkdirp.html#mkdirp]. The
option has the same effect as would have =mkdir -p [directory/subdirectory]=: It
creates all needed (sub-) directories, even when tangling a file. This prevents
the tedious and non-interesting creation of directories within this document.

When dealing with directories and files, Python uses the term /package/ for a
(sub-) directories and /module/ for files within directories, that is
modules.[fn:13:https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#packages]

To prevent having multiple modules having the same name, name-spaces are
used[fn:6:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#python-scopes-and-namespaces].
The main name-space shall be analogous to the projects' name: =qde=. Underneath
the source code folder =src=, each sub-folder represents a package and acts
therefore also as a name-space.

To actually allow a whole package and its modules being imported /as modules/,
it needs to have at least a file inside called =__init__.py=. Those files may be
empty or they may contain regular source code such as classes or methods.

The first stage of the project shows the creation of the /editor/ component, as
it provides the possibility of creating and editing real-time animations which
may then be played back by the /player/ component\cite[p. 29]{osterwalder_qde_2016}.
